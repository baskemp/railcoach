      <h3>Founding of the association</h3>
      <p>We have been talking about this during the half year talk. The founding of the projectlodge as a foundation or association. Today we came to concensus with the board and project coördinators about how we want to found the organization.</p>
      <p>Our plan is to start the organization as a association (Dutch: vereniging) based in the netherlands. An association means that we got to have basic rules (statuten) and we need to have members. We choose this form because it is easiest for us to create and allows for changes in the future when we need to.</p>
      <p>Members means that we got to have members that pay an annual fee to have a vote on association issues. Organization membership only gives the member voting rights. Other people that want to be involved in the projects but do not want to be a paying member of the organization are allowed to do this. The only diffrerence from paying members is that they do not have vote rights.</p>
      <p>This is a proposal that will be presented and discussed during the next half year meeting.</p>

      <h3>Second half yearly meeting</h3>
      <p>The half yearly meetings are the opportunity to present the results from various projects, to give lightning talks to probe for interest in new (concept) projects and, of course, to socialize and chat.</p>
      <p>Although mutch has happened during the half year the group has been together, the organization has stood still for a while. With this meeting the board has shown new commitment by taking on a new board member and changing strategy. The board will work together with the project coördinators to work towards the next half yearly meeting.</p>
      <p>All the projects presented their progress during the meeting. The project coördinators gather their progress and presented together with project contributors.</p>
