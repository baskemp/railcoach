What is railcoach?

Getting started
-------------------------------
Getting the app running is fairly easy if you're familiar with ruby on rails (RoR) 
If you're not familiar with RoR, please don't leave!, there are a lot of good beginner guides [this one for example](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies) And of course we're also happy to help. That's what railcoach is all about!

Prequisites: ruby 1.9.2 & rails 3.0

1. clone the app from github
  Now from the application folder, run the following commands:
2. bundle
3. rake db:migrate

NOTE: for development purposes we initialized [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) for the project.
